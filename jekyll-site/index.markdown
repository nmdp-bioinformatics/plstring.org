## Overview

The PL String Code (PLSC) code system described here combines Phenotype List String (PL String) grammar with established HLA antigen and allotype  nomenclatures, thereby specifying a syntax for encoding of the interpretation of a patient antibody report for consideration in transpplantation

The established HLA nomenclature for antigens is primarily concerned antibody defined categories.  With single-allele bead assays the antigens can be reported as allotype in the format of a 2-field HLA allele.

PL String grammar[^1] is a string format for phenotyping results.

From a terminology standpoint, the result of adding a compositional grammar to an established code system such as HLA nomenclature is a new code system, because the grammar may be used to construct expressions not explicitly defined in the original system as concept codes.

In addition to its usage with HLA nomenclatures, future versions of the PLSC code system could potentially extend it for use with additional genetic nomenclature systems.

## Syntax

See the following for PLSC syntax details.

## About HLA

The HLA gene family provides instructions for making a group of related proteins known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.  The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.[^2]

The HLA gene system plays an important role in the human body and immune system, and it’s medical and clinical significance is extensive, with known areas of impact including transplantation, drug reactions (pharmacogenomics), and disease associations.
